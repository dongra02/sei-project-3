## Process
Identified our project and basic deliverable goals (MVP). In addition, we kept a running 'parking lot' list of features and functionality to be added as time allowed. I worked alongside 1 team member to layout the initial backend models and schemas, as well as request controllers and routes. As the project progressed it became much more frontend heavy and we moved to working on individual components when possible. The team met daily for a morning stand up and evening follow up. In addition, we paired and worked through obstacles as a group when necessary.
